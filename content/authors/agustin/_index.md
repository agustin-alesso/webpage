# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a data scientist with a solid background in agronomy. I received my Ph.D. in Agronomy from National University of Córdoba (Argentina) in 2014. My reasearch interests can be summarized by the intersection of agronomy, applied statistics, and informatics. I want to bring new data science approaches into agriculture to help farmers making their decisions based in data.

I am a data scientist with a solid background in agronomy. I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Agricultural Sciences at National University of the Littoral (Argentina). My reasearch interests can be summarized by the intersection of agronomy, applied statistics, and informatics. I recently joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Postdoctoral Research Associate position in the Department of Crop Sciences. In this position, I am working on new ways to conduct and analyze on-farm experiments for precision agriculture.
